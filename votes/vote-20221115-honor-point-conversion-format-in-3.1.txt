Topic: Accept PR #19681 in 3.1 subject to normal review process
Comment: Fundamentally OTC must decide if in the 3.1 release we should
         honor OSSL_PKEY_PARAM_EC_POINT_CONVERSION_FORMAT as set (and
         default to UNCOMPRESSED) in our provider implementations, and
         apply corresponding changes for handling legacy keys.
